Riemannian Curve Model Analysis: Image Segmentation Application

By giving an initial curve on the image in image segmentation, it can be provided to wrap the objects on the image with the movement of the curve. A segmentation in this class is called partial differential-based segmentation, since there is a partial differential structure that causes the curve motion here. In this study, there is a deep mathematical analysis and numerical calculations related to image segmentation with a mathematical model created from partial derivatives. In numerical calculations, the parameters entered into the model by the user were examined, and the optimization of these parameters with artificial intelligence algorithms was emphasized. In addition, a user-friendly interface application that performs all numerical calculations has been developed. Calculations in the user interface can be made with artificial intelligence algorithms, or if the user wishes, user can make a manual calculation with the values entered into the interface.
